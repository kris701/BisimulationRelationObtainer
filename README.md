# Bisimulation Relation Obtainer
This is a small program to get the bisimulation relations between two processes in DFA format.
It currently have two methods to find these relations:
* A Naive approach
* The Hopcroft and Karp approach

The program has a CLI interface, that accepts DFA's in file format.

## CLI Arguments
There are the following command line arguments:
* `--pprocess`: The path to the one process file
* `--qprocess`: The path to the other process file
* `--obtainer`: What obtainer to use

## File Format
The input file format for this program is very simple, and consists of 3 parts:
* Label declaration
* State declaration
* Transitions

The label declarations is simply a set of what labels are available in the process:
* `{a, b, c, ...}`

The state declarations consists of max three parts and minimum one:
* `[StateName:IsInit:IsFinal]`
The `IsInit` and `IsFinal` is optional.

Lastly, there is the transitions. These describe how to jump from state to state through a label:
* `StateName (LabelName) StateName`
